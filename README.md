üèÜ **The Ultimate Guide to Writing Go Code That Will Make Your Colleagues Cry** üèÜ

Welcome to the most comprehensive collection of Go anti-patterns, bad practices, and code that makes senior developers question their career choices. This repository is a carefully curated museum of software engineering disasters, presented with the utmost sarcasm.

## Philosophy

Why write clean, maintainable code when you can create job security through incomprehensibility? This repository demonstrates cutting-edge techniques in:

- **Goroutine Chaos**: Why use one goroutine when you can spawn millions?
- **Error Suppression**: Errors are just suggestions, right?
- **Interface Abuse**: Because every function parameter should be `interface{}`
- **Concurrency Nightmares**: Race conditions are features, not bugs
- **Naming Conventions**: Single letters are all you need
- **Dependency Injection**: Global variables are the ultimate DI framework

## Structure

Each directory contains:
- Gloriously unmaintainable Go code
- A sarcastic README praising the "revolutionary" techniques
- Examples that violate every best practice imaginable

## Directories

- `goroutines/` - Spawning goroutines like there's no tomorrow
- `error-handling/` - The art of ignoring errors
- `interfaces/` - Empty interfaces everywhere
- `concurrency/` - Race conditions galore
- `naming/` - Variable names that make no sense
- `dependency-injection/` - Global state is the best state

## Disclaimer

**DO NOT use this code in production.** This is an educational repository showcasing what NOT to do in Go programming. If you use any of these patterns in real code, you're on your own.
